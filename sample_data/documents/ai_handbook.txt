ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: A COMPREHENSIVE HANDBOOK
================================================================================

Chapter 1: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
================================================================================

1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in
machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term was first
coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference. AI encompasses a
broad range of technologies including machine learning, natural language
processing, computer vision, and robotics.

The field of AI aims to create systems that can perform tasks that typically
require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech
recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems can be
categorized into narrow AI (designed for specific tasks) and general AI
(capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do).

1.2 History of AI

The history of AI dates back to ancient civilizations where myths spoke of
artificial beings endowed with intelligence. However, the modern field of AI
was founded in 1956 at Dartmouth College. Key milestones include:

- 1950: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test
- 1956: Term "Artificial Intelligence" coined
- 1966: ELIZA, first chatbot, created at MIT

- 2011: IBM Watson wins Jeopardy!
- 2016: AlphaGo defeats Go world champion
- 2022: ChatGPT released, revolutionizing conversational AI

1.3 Types of AI

AI can be categorized in several ways:

By Capability:
- Narrow AI (Weak AI): Specialized in one task
- General AI (Strong AI): Can perform any intellectual task
- Super AI: Hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence
